Hello, World!

My school recently banned phones and made us put it in a bag (like every sensible school), so i'm making this e-paper thing in "retailiation". It should be able to check:

Timetable (implemented)
Bulletin  (implemented)
Homework (W.I.P)

it's designed to run on a waveshare 2.9in touch E-Paper display.

TP_lib that is undefined in the code is the driver for controlling touch and in charge of disaplaying data.
It can be found at: https://files.waveshare.com/upload/4/4e/Touch_e-Paper_Code.zip
