# May 15th: Time Spent: 3hrs

I'm using a touch E-Paper Screen from waveshare. I'm choosing it specifically because of it's ease of use 
and good documentation from waveshare. 

Well, the parts arrived today, very exciting. Originally, this wasn't a hackclub project, it just so happpens that highway launched so coincidentally. 

Today, I soldered the 40pin GPIO headers to my Pi Zero 2 W, and connected the E-Paper Hat onto it.

(please ignore that "fume extractor" that is really just a neck fan at full blast and my lack of soldering skills.)

The Waveshare wiki for this screen is fairly well doccumented, and so I had minimal trouble running its demo. 

Essentially, it was more or less like:

```bash
# Enable I2C and SPI
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
sudo apt-get install python3-pil
sudo apt-get install python3-numpy
```

then download the waveshare demo:
```bash
cd ~
wget https://files.waveshare.com/upload/4/4e/Touch_e-Paper_Code.zip
unzip Touch_e-Paper_Code.zip -d Touch_e-Paper_Code
```

**However when I was running the demo, it kept on giving out epaper busy release.

Well, after contacting waveshare support and getting instantly humbled, I realised I litterally cannot read english.

What I was running was actually the demo code for the 2.19 inch version of this display, haha.

Well, after all that, finnaly got the demo to work. (yay!)

**After that, made a quick python file that shows the time, to test the partial refresh ability of the screen.
(it works!)**

Thank you for reading my horrible journal so far. I'll get started on the main program tommorow

# May 16th: Time Spent: 4hrs

Tried my best to implement a network screen and stats screen, built ontop of the exsisting time partial refresh test. Used api key from openweathermap, and investigated how the touch work.

cpu temp is measured with vcgencmd 
and ram is measure with free

At first, there was no touch debounce and it was constantly polling the cpu instead of checking the INT pins for touch, which lead to multiple touches being registered unintentionally. 

by refrenching the original waveshare demo code, i was sucessfully able to implement debounce. (0.3s)

Also, to prevent the refreshes from slowing down, touch_detection_thread() is started in a seprate thread, to prevent slow downs. 

As this was my first time working with e-paper/e-ink displays, I was unaware that you need to do a full refresh after a set amount of paritals, as to avoid screen burn in. Im not too sure what to set it to, but I think 5 partials for every full refresh should be ok ðŸ¤ž

when touch is deteched, it prints the x,y coordinates in the terminal and then checks if its in the zone of the "button", which is defiend in the touch_detection_thread() 

So far, easier than I expected, actually.

here are some poorly taken pictures

Time dosen't match up since I forgot to take photos that day :/
